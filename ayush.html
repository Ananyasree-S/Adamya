        <h2>Exercise and Mental Health        </h2>

        <h3>Exercise Improves Your Overall Mood        </h3>
        <p>It has been scientifically established that sweating it out releases endorphins (feel-good hormones) in the brain that elevate the mood and make you feel happy. This is primarily the reason why patients grappling with depression are asked to spend plenty of time at the gym.</p>

        <h3>Exercise Helps You Stay Positive        </h3>
        <p>When your mind is idle, you tend to waste your energy in unconstructive thoughts. This lowers your morale and makes you negative. Instead, use this time to work out at the gym or cycle along the countryside.</p>

        <h3>Exercise Boosts Your Brain Power and Efficiency        </h3>
        <p>A study published online revealed that a session of intense aerobic activity promotes neurogenesis (production of new brain cells) and improves your concentration.</p>

        <h3>Exercise Pumps up Your Creative Quotient        </h3>
        <p>A scientific study published in the Frontiers in Human Neurosciences has shown that physical activities can enhance creative thinking. According to this paper, regular exercise has positive effects on convergent and divergent thinking, which are the two crucial components of creativity.</p>

        <h3>Exercise Makes You More Confident        </h3>
        <p>Researchers have claimed that daily physical workouts offer positive psychological benefits such as enhanced self-esteem. Exercise makes you feel good about yourself, gives you a sense of achievement and boosts your self-worth.</p>

        <h2>For a healthy lifestyle</h2>
        <h3>Eat a healthy diet</h3>
        <p>Eat a combination of different foods, including fruit, vegetables, legumes, nuts and whole grains. Adults should eat at least five portions (400g) of fruit and vegetables per day. You can improve your intake of fruits and vegetables by always including veggies in your meal; eating fresh fruit and vegetables as snacks; eating a variety of fruits and vegetables; and eating them in season. By eating healthy, you will reduce your risk of malnutrition and noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as diabetes, heart disease, stroke and cancer.</p>

        <h3>Consume less salt and sugar</h3>
        <p>Filipinos consume twice the recommended amount of sodium, putting them at risk of high blood pressure, which in turn increases the risk of heart disease and stroke. Most people get their sodium through salt. Reduce your salt intake to 5g per day, equivalent to about one teaspoon. It’s easier to do this by limiting the amount of salt, soy sauce, fish sauce and other high-sodium condiments when preparing meals; removing salt, seasonings and condiments from your meal table; avoiding salty snacks; and choosing low-sodium products.

            On the other hand, consuming excessive amounts of sugars increases the risk of tooth decay and unhealthy weight gain. In both adults and children, the intake of free sugars should be reduced to less than 10% of total energy intake. This is equivalent to 50g or about 12 teaspoons for an adult. WHO recommends consuming less than 5% of total energy intake for additional health benefits. You can reduce your sugar intake by limiting the consumption of sugary snacks, candies and sugar-sweetened beverages.</p>

        <h3>Reduce intake of harmful fats</h3>
        <p>Fats consumed should be less than 30% of your total energy intake. This will help prevent unhealthy weight gain and NCDs. There are different types of fats, but unsaturated fats are preferable over saturated fats and trans-fats. WHO recommends reducing saturated fats to less than 10% of total energy intake; reducing trans-fats to less than 1% of total energy intake; and replacing both saturated fats and trans-fats to unsaturated fats.

            The preferable unsaturated fats are found in fish, avocado and nuts, and in sunflower, soybean, canola and olive oils; saturated fats are found in fatty meat, butter, palm and coconut oil, cream, cheese, ghee and lard; and trans-fats are found in baked and fried foods, and pre-packaged snacks and foods, such as frozen pizza, cookies, biscuits, and cooking oils and spreads.</p>
    
        <h3>Be active</h3>
        <p>Physical activity is defined as any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that requires energy expenditure. This includes exercise and activities undertaken while working, playing, carrying out household chores, travelling, and engaging in recreational pursuits. The amount of physical activity you need depends on your age group but adults aged 18-64 years should do at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity throughout the week. Increase moderate-intensity physical activity to 300 minutes per week for additional health benefits.</p>
    
        <h3>Drink only safe water</h3>
        <p>Drinking unsafe water can lead to water-borne diseases such as cholera, diarrhoea, hepatitis A, typhoid and polio. Globally, at least 2 billion people use a drinking water source contaminated with faeces. Check with your water concessionaire and water refilling station to ensure that the water you’re drinking is safe. In a setting where you are unsure of your water source, boil your water for at least one minute. This will destroy harmful organisms in the water. Let it cool naturally before drinking.</p>
        
        <h3>Have regular check-ups</h3>
        <p>Regular check-ups can help find health problems before they start. Health professionals can help find and diagnose health issues early, when your chances for treatment and cure are better. Go to your nearest health facility to check out the the health services, screenings and treatment that are accessible to you.</p>

        <h2>Homegrown herbal remedies</h2>
        
        <h3>Calendula (Calendula officinalis)</h3>
        <p>Calendula is also known as pot marigold. It’s a centuries-old antifungal, antiseptic, wound-healing ally. The petals of these cheerful yellow-and-orange daisy-like flowers lend skin-soothing properties to many natural cosmetics and diaper creams.

            Calendula is a freely reseeding annual that blooms all season long. It makes a lovely addition to gardens with full sun. Harvest the petals fresh. You can also dry entire blooms — which close in the evening — before they form seeds.</p>
        <h3>Cilantro (Coriandrum sativum)        </h3>
        <p>Cilantro boasts a unique flavor that people either love or hate. The leaves often garnish Mexican and Thai dishes. The seeds, known as coriander, are a prime ingredient in Indian curries.

            Few think of this plant as a medicinal herb, but researchTrusted Source shows it’s a powerful digestive aid and may be capable of removing heavy metals and other toxic agents from the body.
            
            Cilantro grows best in a cool, moist garden and will quickly bolt in hot weather. Look for slow bolt varieties from seed companies.</p>
        <h3>Lemon balm (Melissa officinalis)        </h3>
        <p>The oils, tannins, and bitters in the fragrant leaves and flowers of lemon balm have a relaxing, antispasmodic effect on the stomach and nervous system. It may help fight off viruses such as herpes simplex when used topically, according to a 2008 study.

            Lemon balm is tasty and gentle enough for children when prepared in teas or tinctures with a glycerin base.
            
            This calming and uplifting perennial makes a pretty patch of bright green in the garden and is a great plant to grow fresh. The dried herb loses some potency after six months. Try this lemon balm and peppermint infusion.</p>
        <h3>Peppermint</h3>
        <p>Spearmint and peppermint are familiar flavors in toothpaste and chewing gum. Both pack a powerfully refreshing zing, but the National Center for Complementary and Integrative HealthTrusted Source (NCCIH) reports that peppermint provides stronger medicine than its more culinary cousin.

            When brewed as tea, peppermint may relieve digestive discomforts such as indigestion and vomiting. It can also soothe sore muscles when applied topically as a liquid or lotion.</p>
        <h3>Rosemary</h3>
        <p>Rosemary is the great reviver. This perennial woody herb stimulates energy and optimism and sharpens memory and concentration by bringing more oxygen to your brain. It’s a wonderfully stimulating alternative to caffeine when you need that second wind.</p>
